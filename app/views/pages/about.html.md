## Learnery

Learnery is a rails app you can use to organize open learning events, 
like railsbridge, barcamps, user groups, meetups, hackathons. 

You can adapt the theme to your liking 
and deploy the app to heroku in a few simple steps.

### This Site

Look at the URL of this site: 

http://learnery-staging-coderdojo.herokuapp.com/

is it the official demo site of Learnery with theme-coderdojo.

Do you see a diffrent URL?  Then this is some 
installation of learnery, with the theme-coderdojo
installed, showing the default static pages that come with it.

### This Theme

This theme was designed with an events for kids in mind. 
(If you use it, please replace the images in ./vendor/assets/images/ first!)

The rsvp-page does not display infos (neither names nor numbers).
See file app/views/events/_rsvp.html.erb  and the readme of
learnery for the methods and partials you might use there to change this.
